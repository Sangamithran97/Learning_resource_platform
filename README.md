# Learning_resource_platform
A learning resource platform made using XAMPP

The php files are present and we have to use the phpmyadmin as database to create tables and store data

In xampp we enable apache and mysql and execute the program in website http://localhost/learning_platform/__?__.php
The changes are reflected in localhost/phpmyadmin
